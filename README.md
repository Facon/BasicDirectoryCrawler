# BasicDirectoryCrawler
Very simple directory crawler.

# Background
During [Euskal Encounter 16](https://euskalencounter.org) in 2008, there was a 2 day programming competition. The goal was simple, to create a directory crawler where you are able to search for specific files with bonus points for extras, such a user interface.

Unfortunately, I barely learned how to program at the time, I couldn't manage to deliver a working version at the time. Some days later, I managed to finish a working version for console, where file paths are dumped to a text file. You can search file names and path with text editor.
